<h1>About</h1>
    <div id="aboutText">
<p><em>The Thrillville Quarterly</em> is an online magazine serving the purpose of reflecting about <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/" target="blank_">LucasArts</a> past, present and future. Using imaginative means, we strive to shed light were none has before. Our magazine shall be an exercise in creativity, presenting our thoughts in the most entertaining, illuminating and original way possible.</p>
<br>
<h3>Origin</h3>

<p>In late 2006, <em>Thrillville</em> came out, it was the first non-Star Wars game published by LucasArts in many years. This inspired me to make <a href="../archive/thrillville/">a little website</a> that pretended to be a <em>Thrillville</em> fansite, but it had the real intention of showing to new unsuspecting generations, the greatness of the golden years of LucasArts. In 2007, <em>Thrillville: Off The Rails</em> was released. This time, I took the opportunity to <a href="../archive/off_the_rails/">update the site</a> and show my disappointment and loss of hope for the company.<br>
Suddenly, in 2009 things changed, LucasArts re-released part of their classics on Steam, they put out special editions of the first two Monkey Island games, they allowed Telltale to make <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em>, and they even developed a small original game in-house: <em>Lucidity</em>. That's when I decided that <em>The Thrillville Quarterly</em> was needed, a publication that would follow the resurgence of LucasArts.</p>
<br>
<h3>Why LucasArts?</h3>

<p>Our love for LucasArts comes mainly from the days of their excellent point-and-click adventure games, such as <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em>, <em>Maniac Mansion</em>, <em>Sam & Max: Hit The Road</em>, <em>Indiana Jones and The Fate of Atlantis</em>, <em>Grim Fandango</em>, etc. However, since the turn of the century, the company's direction has been less satisfactory, focusing on exploiting their two main intellectual properties (<em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em>), neglecting the possibility of generating new ones, changing management more often than it makes sense and so on and so forth.</p>

<br>
<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>We want to look at their body of work through a new prism, observe the company's current actions from a safe distance and contemplate their future in order to save them from their own demise. That's right, LucasArts, we will save you. (Or we'll hold your head under the water, if you are beyond salvation.)
