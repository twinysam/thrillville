                in a galaxy which I hope it's the same...<br>
                <br>
                There was a company called LucasFilm Games, which later evolved 
                into LucasArts. In the days of yore, this company did a whole 
                lot more than StarWars games.<br>
                Back then they had a lot of... original adventure games! Oh yes, 
                beautiful pieces of games. What was so special about them? Simple. 
                They were good stories. They didn't care about technology, next-gen 
                platforms, polygons and stuff like that. Why? Simple. Because 
                none of those thing make a great game on it's own, just the same 
                way awesome special effects don't make great movies on it's own.<br>
                They cared about good stories and fun interactivity. That's all 
                that matters on story-driven games.<br>
                Sadly, at the dawn of the new millennium they progressively stopped 
                making those games, and focused on making games that rarely had 
                something special in them.<br>
                <br>
                So, young player, do you want to know what does games were about?

                      When the company was first called LucasFilm games, Brian 
                      Moriarty created this neat fantasy adventure game. An ancient 
                      (or futuristic) story about a guild of magicians that can 
                      weave music in order to achieve magic. The end of existence 
                      played with a LucasFilm spark in it. Magical.</font></p>

                      While some might assume that all of LucasArts' adventure 
                      games in the early 1990s were humorous, that's not actually 
                      the case. Loom, released in 1990, was a serious and thought-provoking 
                      fantasy adventure. Players assumed the role of Bobbin Threadbare, 
                      a 17-year-old boy in the Guild of Weavers. But instead of 
                      weaving thread, Bobbin used a staff to weave magical music 
                      that helped him challenge a darkness that had overcome the 
                      land. The player casts magic spells by using notes on the 
                      standard musical C major scale. On lower difficulty settings, 
                      it was not necessary to know how to read or write music 
                      to successfully complete the game. Many players fondly remember 
                      the beautiful classical music in the game, not to mention 
                      Bobbin's epic journey to destroy darkness.<br>

                      Another young man would begin his own epic journey in October 
                      1990. Guybrush Threepwood was a pirate-wannabe who starred 
                      in his own comedy adventure, The Secret of Monkey Island.<br>
                      Set on Melee Island in the Caribbean, Guybrush battled against 
                      the evil ghost pirate LeChuck who had captured the beautiful 
                      governor of the island, Elaine Marley. During the game, 
                      Guybrush had to complete three trials to become a pirate: 
                      thievery, verbal insult sword fighting, and treasure hunting. 
                      Most of the fun in the game came from the branching dialog 
                      trees, where players had the chance to select how they conversed 
                      with in-game characters.<br>

                      While Lucasfilm Games had published an Indiana Jones game 
                      in 1989 to coincide with the film Indiana Jones and the 
                      Last Crusade, 1993 brought the release of the first original 
                      Indiana Jones game. The plot for Indiana Jones and the Fate 
                      of Atlantis was completely new. It told the tale of how 
                      Indiana and his cohort Sophia raced to find Atlantis before 
                      the Third Reich could use the Lost City's power for evil. 
                      Besides including LucasArts' trademark witty dialogue and 
                      interesting puzzles, Fate of Atlantis featured multiple 
                      ways to complete the game. Part way through the adventure, 
                      players selected between three paths: the more action-oriented 
                      FISTS path; the intellectually stimulating WITS path; or 
                      the TEAM path where Sophia would offer Indy hints during 
                      their adventure. The game also came out as a &#147;talkie&#148; 
                      CD-ROM with more than 8,000 lines of dialogue.<br>

                      Bernard, a loveable computer geek; Laverne, a sleep deprived 
                      medical student; and Hoagie, a brain-dead rock roadie. These 
                      characters were brought together to prevent Dr. Fred's Purple 
                      Tentacle from taking over the world. Using a Chron-O-John 
                      time machine, made out of three port-o-potties and a VW 
                      Bug, characters passed objects back and forth through time.<br>

                      In Full Throttle, another one of LucasArts' classic &#147;talkie&#148; 
                      CD-ROM adventures, players assumed the role of Ben, a biker 
                      framed for the murder of Malcolm Corley, head of Corley 
                      Motors. As the adventure begins, players begin a quest to 
                      clear Ben's name by finding the real killer. In addition 
                      to regular adventure game sequences, Full Throttle was notable 
                      for its first-person motorcycle action elements, where Ben 
                      battled rival bikers on winding canyon roads. Full Throttle, 
                      known for its outstanding voice acting, featured the voice 
                      of Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) as the menacing villain 
                      Ripburger.<br>

                      A dramatic and mythical story of crime and corruption set 
                      the stage for Grim Fandango, a film noir-inspired adventure 
                      game that chronicled the story of Manny Calavera, a travel 
                      agent in the Land of the Dead. Working for the Department 
                      of Death, Manny's job was to pick up people in the Land 
                      of the Living and bring them to the Land of the Dead for 
                      a four-year journey across the underworld. But Manny has 
                      a big problem: He can't meet his sales quota because he's 
                      not getting any good clients. Soon, Manny discovers a conspiracy 
                      is afoot, and the real adventure begins. Grim Fandango was 
                      heralded for its incredible visual style inspired by Mexican 
                      folklore, not to mention its engaging story with 55 characters 
                      and 7,000 lines of dialogue. The game's interface also was 
                      unique, as players used their keyboards - instead of a mouse 
                      - to move a 3D rendition of Manny around the game environment.<br>

              represents the last really original LucasArts game (by really original 
              I mean a completely new story. And yes, I know there was also <i>Mercenaries</i>...but 
              I don't think it was as creatively good as GF) and that happened 
              in 1998.<br>
              <br>
              Fortunately since that time to present we have had other designers 
              and companies outside LucasArts make some great games.<br>
              <br>
              Let's take a quick look at some of those games that are related 
              more or less with LucasArts at some extent:<br>

                      One absolutely awesome game I haven't played yet. But I 
                      could bet my weird coin collection on it's EXCELLENCE. It's 
                      not a plain adventure game, it's actually an action/adventure, 
                      or platformer. A MUST.<br>
                      It was also the winner of the 2006 BAFTA Award for Best

                      Rather impressive amateur game, I just have started it and 
                      was quite surprised by it. It's made by just one guy (Yahtzee). 
                      This game it's the sequel to <a href="http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/5days/">5 
                      Days a Stranger</a> which I recommend you play first (for 
                      FREE). I just selected this one because it looks better 
                      (and also discovered it first). It's definitely not for 
                      young kids (as it contains much blood).</font></p>

                      that it seems the creator of this game has actually played

                <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#666633">So, having reviewed 
                all this lovely games we shall now discuss a few topics.<br>
                <br>
                Unfortunately since LucasArts started to take less and less smart 
                creative decisions most of the great designers they had eventually 
                left the company (fortunately most of them keep trying to make 
                good games).<br>
                I believe that at the end of this dark tunnel filled with endless 
                Star Wars games there is very thin thin so thin light of hope. 
                This very thin line is divided in two factors that could eventually 
                make THE DIFFERENCE.<br>
                <br>
                <b>A)</b> What you wanted to know..... What is Thrillville? Well, 
                Thrillville represents the first original (not based on an existing 
                franchise) LucasArts game in a long time. Personally, I don't 
                think it's a great game (I haven't played, but I researched it) 
                and I think it's not the worst game ever either. Anyway, it makes 
                me somewhat happy to see that LucasArts did something that is 
                not Star Wars or Indiana Jones.<br>
                <br>
                <b>B)</b> Is the hope that the people, the gamers can make ALL 
                the difference. If everybody starts buying and playing games like 
                Psychonauts and old 2D games, then inevitably the game companies 
                are going to start making more and more of those games, and less 
                and less the same uncreative first person shooters. And then more 
                and more creative people will start getting interest in the game 
                industry. And then start working on games. And then the utopia 
                comes true.<br>

                If this games sell more than Star Wars game they will notice it

                speak to the man itself. The person responsible for the &quot;Lucas&quot; 
                in &quot;LucasArts&quot;, of course, I'm talking about Mr. George 
                Lucas. Despite he is not involved in making the games, his name 
                is on every single one of them, and he certainly can have a voice 
                on who is to run the company or what direction should it take. 
                Write him a letter to let him know how much you loved the old 
                games and how badly you want LucasArts to make good and fresh 
                stories again. <br>

                I will also like to contribute to the cause, offering (during 
                2007, at least) the following public services:<br>
                <br>
                You can email me if...<br>
                <br>
                - You want assistance with any of the above games. If you have 
                technical problems with them I promise to at least find where 
                you have to address your problem. If you got stuck in one of them 
                I will give you hints or solutions for that specific part (If 
                I haven't played it, I will try to look for it, or at least provide 
                a guide)<br>
                <br>
                - You are interested in good creative games, but not really into 
                adventure games. I can recommend to you games of different genres 
                that I have either played and know they are good, or games I &quot;feel&quot; 
                are good. I will also provide official sites, buying links and 
                demo links for any of these.<br>
                <br>
                - You want to change the game industry beyond LucasArts. I can 
                provide with a couple of ideas on how could you contribute to 
                make it better.<br>
                <br>
                - You simply want to chat a little bit about good games.<br>
