Once more we have very little in the way of correspondence. It would seem that either our readership is shy, or that they don't have much to say. Or perhaps we just don’t have all that many readers. I'm reluctant to decide and I would rather continue in encouraging all of you to have your say, to have your words immortalized in this humble and occasionally ambivalent publication.
What is that? We have actually received an electronic letter? Well, what do you know… and it's old too, from late 2009, shortly after our first issue was released in the form of a blunt PDF. Let us read it, shall we?</p>

<cite><p>Dear Editor,</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">I was delighted to receive a copy of the Quarterly this Sunday past, to which I contributed my little piece to.
However, I did notice one point that needs to be corrected: you call me Sir Gabriel Schenk, which is technically incorrect. Though it is true that I was knighted in 1978 for services to the British Empire, I was forced to renounce my knighthood three years later, when I became an honorary Texan.
Regrettably, using my title has since then become a beheadable offence. Whilst it is unlikely that Her Majesty will read the Quarterly, one does feel that the “safe side” is altogether the best place to be in this situation. I have, after all, grown rather attached to my head being connected to my shoulders.</p>

</p>I remain, sirs,<br>
Your most obliged, obedient<br>
Servant</p>

<p>G.W.J. Schenk<br>
B.S., M.B (Dunelm), F.R.F.P. & S., F.R.S.Ed.</p></cite>


<p>Good old Mr. Schenk… of course Her Majesty reads <em>The Thrillville Quarterly</em>. That's why I proceeded to amend this mistake right away, since a decapitated writer is of almost no use to me. Allow me to also take this opportunity to thank you for another sterling contribution to this issue; having never played <em>Escape from Monkey Island</em>, I found your piece to be rather insightful nonetheless. I trust your words will grace our next issue as well; Her Majesty would like that.</p>

<p>I feel obliged to indulge in another writing spree of imaginary correspondence that will serve as an example and inspiration to all of you.</p>

<cite><p>Dear Editor,</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Even though we have never met, I feel as though you know me intimately. The Thrillville Quarterly appeals to my tastes and interests to such a stunning degree, that it makes me wonder if it wasn't indeed tailored especially for me. It wouldn't be the first time such a thing has occurred. Maniac Mansion, one of the most enjoyable games I have played, features my favourite seven kinds of people: Nerds, hapless boyfriends, photographers, punk chicks, new age musicians and unassuming white girls. It was Ron Gilbert's kind gesture towards me.</p>

<p>I impatiently look forward to the next issue of this magnificent publication.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,<br>
Elizabeth R.<br>
Queen of The Commonwealth Realms,<br>
Buckingham Palace, London, England.</p></cite>

<p>Another brilliant example my fingers have produced. You are welcome to write about as varied a subject as you wish. Not only are you encouraged to express your opinion regarding the articles we have published, but also of any thought you may have on LucasArts. Maybe you want to express your concerns about whomever might be the next President of the company. Maybe you wish to share with us the point in life in which this current issue finds you. Whatever it might be, cake and a warm blanket await your words, so do not hesitate in sending them our way.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully,<br>
— The Editor</p>
