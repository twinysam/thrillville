<p class="article">
Unlike the many <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Steven+Paul+Meegan+mugshots&hl=en&safe=off&prmd=imvnso&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=3HhPUKwEhdnRAZLhgKgP&ved=0CDEQsAQ&biw=1024&bih=664" target="blank_">mugshots of Steven Paul Meegan</a>, a 62 year old repeat offender from Portland, Oregon, all the available pictures of former LucasArts president Paul Meegan depict him with a smile. Why is he smiling?<br>
On August 2, 2012, he stopped working at the company that was long ago known for releasing memorable games. LucasArts had this to say of Mr. Meegan: “Paul has been a valuable member of the Lucasfilm leadership team and we wish him the best in his future endeavors.” “Valuable,” like a leftover hamburger when you come home at 3 in the morning without having had dinner. “LucasArts has come a long way and I’m extremely proud of what the teams have accomplished,” said Meegan, “we had a great E3 with <em>Star Wars 1313</em>, and have other exciting projects in the works. It’s been a privilege to be a part of Lucasfilm.” Then why did you leave, eh, Paul Meegan?</p>

<p>We can trace Meegan's career as far back as 1997, when he co-founded (with Ken Klopp) Sinister Games, a company that produced a handful of IP games no one has ever heard of (<em>Batman: Gotham City Racer</em>, <em>The Dukes of Hazzard: Racing for Home</em>) before they sold it to Ubisoft in 2000. He is also the designer of the 1999 game <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0ya_BjYDXM" target="blank_"><em>Shadow Company: Left for Dead</em></a>, a fairly decent-looking RTS game. In 2002, he moved to China (working mostly for a number of video game companies), and remained there until he came to LucasArts in June 2010. In 2007 he gave a keynote speech at GDC China as the CEO of Epic China, entitled <em>The Possibilities and Perils of Production Outsourcing, And How It’s Changing the Way Games Are Made</em>. He seems to be a savvy and budget conscious producer who strives for efficiency.<br>
“We’re surrounded by staggeringly bright and creative people at the top of their games,” Meegan said in one of the very few interviews he gave as president of LucasArts. I wish I could ask him which games are those (in fact I tried, but neither he, nor his former partner, Ken Klopp, replied to my request for comments). Yet he also said something with which I agree completely: “Star Wars lends itself to all kinds of games”. This is something that so far has only been occasionally explored, with one big exception: the Lego Star Wars games. There is such a wide variety of characters and creatures in the Star Wars universe, which could be used in any number of game genres. Alas, LucasArts has always had a tendency to pursue the hardcore gamer target exclusively. Meegan also stated that he intended to focus mainly on Star Wars games, and by that I'm assuming that the first person shooter and the possible flight simulator in development, were/are/will be Star Wars games.<br>
What has he done at LucasArts exactly? We can only speculate. There's been talk of changing the production pipeline, re-structuring the company, and so on and so forth, but we haven't yet seen any tangible results of those alleged achievements. On his LinkedIn profile, he describes himself as a “change agent” with experience in turnaround management, a sort of company saving ninja. However, if his job at LucasArts was completed, there is no good reason why he wouldn't have said so in the press statement. “Rebuilt production organization and product pipeline culminating in unveiling of <em>Star Wars: 1313</em>, winning 31 nominations and 10 awards at E3 2012. Managed MI-6 award winning launch of <em>Lego Star Wars III</em>” says Meegan of his Presidency at LucasArts. Which I can rephrase as “Presenting a tech demo at E3”, but the more I see of <em>Star Wars 1313</em>, the more I hold back my skepticism. For all we know, he might as well have pushed LucasArts closer to where it needs to be as a big video game company, even if he sacrificed the love for their legacy. His LinkedIn cites no current job (other than being on the board of directors at GameDesk Institute, a position he took in 2011). I'm inclined to think that his departure from LucasArts was not something he wanted; one of those management disagreement situations.</p>

<p>You can probably tell I did my homework for this article (you had better; I spent some good hours researching this, I’m trying to be journalistic here). I turned as many stones as I could find, I tracked down relevant people only to be ignored by them. I didn't find anything particularly interesting, only little bits and pieces of the puzzle I conveniently decided Paul Meegan is. Every person has a story, but I don't really know what his is. I think I'm fine with that, I think I prefer not knowing what his Rosebud is.<br>
One thing I can assume: unlike former LucasArts president Jim Ward, Paul Meegan likes games. I can easily picture him playing them, and he has also worked on a few. His smile seems honest, the kind of smile which is the result of being unable to contain or hide one's joy. A family man that probably enjoys life, a man who doesn't look like someone who lives under stress. Does his smile hide more than it lets on? I don't think so, but I believe it does hide something. On the day of his resignation he opened a <a href="http://twitter.com/PaulMeegan" target="blank_">Twitter account</a> and wrote: “Farewell to my friends and colleagues at LucasArts & Lucasfilm. It's been a privilege. Now, next up.”</p>

<p class="endArticle">Why is Paul Meegan smiling? I don't know, but it makes me feel like everything is going to be fine. I like to think he now smiles because he knows what the <em>Handsome Halibut</em> is.</p>
