In previous years I found myself surprised when LucasArts released <em>Thrillville,</em> its first new IP in years, to a degree of wanting to do something about it. So, I aimed to create a <a href="../../thrillville/">fake fan website</a> with the real intention being that of showing to new generations of LucasArts gamers a glimpse of the golden years; at the time, I was hopeful, believing that <em>Thrillville</em> could mean there would be more attempts at creating new original titles. By the following year, <em>Thrillville: Off The Road</em> was released and all my hopes were squandered. You see, I grew up (like you, probably) playing such extraordinary games as <em>Secret of Monkey Island</em>, <em>Full Throttle</em>, <em>The Dig</em>, <em>Indiana Jones and The Fate of Atlantis</em> and even the occasional Star Wars title like <em>Rebel Assault II</em>, <em>Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2</em> and even <em>Yoda Stories</em>. Many of those games were as much a part of my life as was learning to ride a bike; they were great adventures, amazing stories that would not only entertain me but also enkindle a curiosity in topics from diverse areas in history and science at a young age. Those are the kind of traits that come with reading good books and that's exactly what those LucasArts games were like.<br>
As the years passed and the game industry (d)evolved, one by one all the great LucasArts game designers left the company and the new IPs were becoming increasingly scarce. If that wasn't enough, the great classic titles were ignored and buried as if they had never happened, probably as a way to avoid the embarrassment of having their current titles pale in comparison with the creativity and greatness of those old games. Or maybe they just didn't care about them.</p>

<p>When <em>Thrillville: Off The Road</em> came out I thought it was time to <a href="../../off_the_rails/">update the website</a>. I felt obtuse for having put hope in LucasArts and I didn't hesitate in expressing that feeling. I basically pointed the readers in the direction of two new games that reminded me of the quality there once was in LucasArts games. At the time I even failed to realize that <em>Thrillville</em> was not even developed in-house at LucasArts - it was developed by Frontier, an English studio. Boy, was I goosey.</p>

<p>I recall that earlier this year I found myself a little embarrassed by following LucasArts on its brand new Twitter account, but not long thereafter I noticed (with a slight amount of distrust) that <em>Fate of Atlantis</em> was mentioned with increasing regularity. I knew that it was mainly due to the fact that in <em>Indiana Jones and The Staff of Kings</em> the game can be unlocked, but there was more to it than that…<br>
Between June and July of this year, a series of announcements by LucasArts left me flabbergasted. Games like <em>Loom</em>, <em>The Dig</em> and <em>Fate of Atlantis</em> were being released on Steam! <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em> was re-released in a brand new special edition and a new series of Monkey Island games would be developed by Telltale! I couldn't believe it. That meant new generations of gamers could discover these titles and play them for chicken feed. And if that wasn't enough, it was later announced that <em>Lucidity</em>, a brand new IP, would be released - somebody pinch me in the arm!</p>

<p class="endArticle">I know I probably shouldn't, I know they still have a Brobdingnagian amount of work to do to make up for all the mediocrity they have unleashed over the last few years, but I can't help it. As the poster on Fox Mulder's office prays: I want to believe (again).</p>
