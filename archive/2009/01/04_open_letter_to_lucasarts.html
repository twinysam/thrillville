Dear LucasArts,</p>
<p style="text-indent: 10px;">
    I'm writing to you in an enchanting spring night, a subtle breeze entering my wide open window and Beethoven's 7th Symphony allegretto filling the room with life. While I'm unsure of how to say what I have in mind, I'm quite sure of what I want to say.<br>
At first I was considering addressing this letter to the current LucasArts director, Darrell Rodriguez, being ultimately responsible for the company's operations. But then I realized I wanted to talk to every single part that contributes in moving the machine forward. Nevertheless, I do have something to say to Mr. Rodriguez. Even though most likely you never knew about it (just like most of the current readership), I previously claimed you would probably never release any creative and new original games. Therefore, I publicly apologize, even in the presence of such a harmless and non-insulting claim: I did misjudge you and I feel sorry about it, as I was without a doubt proven wrong. Apologies done, I may now proceed.</p>

<p>Oh LucasArts, you dream weaver, you fancy machine, maker of wonders, creator of joy.  Once upon a time you filled my life with fun and excitement, but then, just like a drunken wife-beating bastard who once was charming and humorous, you took it all away and turned everything into sorrow and weeping. You disappointed me (and many others), neglecting all those marvelous things you did, shutting down your factory, thinking in numbers, having others produce for you and stamping your name on trash, turning yourself into something nobody could ever be proud of.<br>
But then, when I had lost all hope and was getting ready to walk away from you for good (or try to), just then, you did something unexpected. You suddenly acknowledged and re-released many of the wonderful things you did, you provided an opportunity for one of those to be continued, and… you created something new, all by yourself.</p>

<p>I couldn't help but turn my eyes to you again. I couldn't avoid getting excited once more. You are not the same I first met long ago, but there is a spark that reminds me of those days. You have changed, but so have I.<br>
I'm not happy because you are pleasing me again, I'm content because those things you are doing are beneficial for yourself. Still, you have a lot of hard work ahead of you in order to make up for all the misery you put me through. I will never let you forget what you did, but I'm willing to cease tormenting you as long as you keep walking this path.</p>

<p>I want you to think of me as your guardian angel, looking after you from above. But be warned: whenever you make foolish choices I'll be there to point them out in harsh mockery; and should you ever disappoint me again, like you did before, then you'll find yourself never again being able to wake up from an endless and tortuous nightmare. Doomed for all eternity.<br>
But worry not, darling, I'm sure you'll do just fine.</p>

<p>Even though our relationship is not the same anymore (and probably never will be), if you keep impressing me like you are doing, who knows, we might even dance together one more time, for old times' sake.</p>
