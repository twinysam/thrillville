<p class="article">It's funny how ironic things can turn out to be. Last year, in my state of "giving up on LucasArts" I <a href="../../../archive/off_the_rails/">wrote about</a> two independent games I was really looking forward to (one of which recently came out and I strongly recommend you to try). Those games have one thing in common (well, maybe more than one, but I'm trying to make a point here): they both look absolutely beautiful and their artful visual presentations should be more than enough of an invitation for anyone to want to try them. It is comical that I was showing two games I thought were completely outside LucasArts' range of reality (or even fantasy), to find myself a year later enjoying the delicious irony of witnessing a LucasArts game whose artistry can perfectly coexist with those other two titles.</p>

<p>Lucidity is the first non-Star Wars, non-Indiana Jones title developed in-house by LucasArts since <em>Gladius</em> (October 2003). Yes, your math is correct, it's been exactly six years since an internally generated IP was released. I could talk about why that six year period was the bleakest in the company's history, or I could just talk about <em>Lucidity</em>. I think the latter is more optimistic.</p>

<p>This game was created by the same team that delivered <em>The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition</em>. The team, known as "Labs", apparently has the mission of creating new IPs for digital delivery platforms (Steam, Direct2Drive, XBLA, iPhone/iPod Touch, etc), having those products featured on a lower profile than those belonging to the big LucasFilm franchises. For instance, <em>Lucidity</em>'s official site is the LucasArts Workshop (Labs) blog and doesn't have its own site like Monkey Island. Considering the nature of a laboratory, this probably means they are experimenting, playing with new concepts while consolidating a strong development team to get it ready for the major league.<br>
The first project made from scratch in the labs is <em>Lucidity</em>, a 2D platformer/puzzle game. I probably read more reviews for this game than for any other title (at least in such a short period of time) and almost none fails to mention <em>Lemmings</em> and <em>Tetris</em> as comparisons, and that's because <em>Lucidity</em> takes the concept of having no direct control over the character, who is in need of your god-like help (<em>Lemmings</em>), and matches this idea with one of randomizing the elements needed for accomplishing that task (<em>Tetris</em>). The combination of these two known concepts is an interesting approach, but despite its novelty it manages to fail on some fundamental levels. The most essential is the learning curve; in <em>Lemmings</em>, every time you lose is an opportunity to improve on your strategy and there is a big chance that every time you play the same level you'll be more likely to win than in your previous attempt. <em>Tetris</em>, probably one of the best games (if not the very best) of all time, involves pure logic, and while there are times in which your failure or success will depend on the next piece, it is unlikely that you will often find yourself in that situation. Whereas in <em>Lucidity</em> there is no substantial thing you can learn that would get you through the game; in here there is only hoping for the best. The frustration factor, while absolutely damaging the gaming experience, can for the most part be forgiven because pretty much all the other elements that compose the game are absolutely beautiful. The enchanting character design by Andrea Rhodes is nothing but delightful, the animations by Jeff Brown and Saul Ruiz are incredibly alive and believable, the environment art by Molly Denmark is perfectly fitting and amazing, the music by Jesse Harling is really appropriate and creates an excellent atmosphere, while the sound design by Tom Bible fills this whole world with an equally great soundscape. Overall, the setting and artistry found in this game is one that should make many games envious, but I can't help to think they made a mistake by putting the wrong gameplay into this gorgeous world they have created.</p>

<p class="endArticle">What I get from all this is still very positive. They do have many things to learn from this first experience, but on the checklist they got most of the items right the first time. I see a promising team, capable of delivering great games in the immediate future. <em>Lucidity</em> is very, very different from all the LucasArts classics, and I think it is a good omen that, while they are certainly inspired by those great games, they aren't trying to force back that style - they are attempting something new, and that feels right. This game represents the beginning of a new era in LucasArts history, and here I am, just like in <em>Lucidity</em>, hoping for the best.</p>
