Oh, hello there, I didn't hear you coming. I was just looking through the mail and I realized (with deep, deep sadness) that there isn't any. I wonder, why would that be? Oh, right, because this is the first issue. Now that you have read it, you are probably having many uneasy thoughts in your head that are eager to pop out  in the form of a written letter to us. The only problem is, you don't know how to do that. Well, let me tell you: what you have to do is write it as a proper letter and address it to either the magazine or to whoever wrote the particular article you wish to comment on. Also, you'll need to include your full real name (you can include your nickname between parentheses), your academic degree (should you have any, and there is no need to feel bad if you don't; the fact that you read this whole magazine and understood it probably means you have an IQ of at least 138), if you are proud of your job feel free to add it, and last but not least: remember to tell us where you are from (city, country). As for length, it can be anything up to 500 words. Let me give you a fictional example:</p>

<em><p>Dear Editor,</p>
        <pstyle="text-indent: 10px;">It is with nothing but sorrow that I feel obliged to inform you that the writing found across the pages of The Thrillville Quarterly inevitably manages to make myself vomit.</p>

<p>My highest regards,<br>
<strong>Sir Chester Wilminghton III, M.D.</strong><br>
Dean of Medicine, University of Northampton.<br>
Northampton, England.</p></em>

<p>Bravo! What a remarkable example, that I couldn't have written better myself, except I just did. LucasArts employees or representatives are more than welcome to write, as well as any other member of the video game industry. But overall, we are willing to publish letters from anyone having something interesting to say.</p>

<p>Please send your letters to the following electronic mail address:</p>

<p>thrillvillequarterly [at] gmail [dot] com</p>

<p>Letters selected for publication might be edited for length and style (but never for content or meaning). Electronic mail will not be returned unless you indicate otherwise. Our digital mailbox facility is already functioning and our trusted computer operators are ready, waiting to process your correspondence.</p>

<p class="endArticle">Yours faithfully,<br>
- The Editor</p>
