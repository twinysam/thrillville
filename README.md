# The Thrillville Quarterly

A never quite quarterly, short-lived, publication about LucasArts. We only managed two issues, but not long after the second one, LucasFilm was sold to Disney, LucasArts effectively ceased to exist, and eventually a few more classic LucasArts adventure games got remastered and re-released.

A third and final issue might one day happen, although probably not. In the meantime, this is a good resting place for the fine work of my collaborators.
